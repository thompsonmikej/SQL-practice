# SQL-practice

**Developed at devCodeCamp**

A hands-on exercise in writing SQL queries to extract, filter, and summarize data from relational databases. This project introduces fundamental SQL concepts including table creation, data insertion, and data retrieval with SELECT statements.

---

## Features

- Practice with database structure and table creation (`CREATE TABLE`)
- Writing and executing SQL queries to extract and filter data using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT`
- Use of entity-relationship diagrams (ERD) to visualize table relationships and plan queries
- Fundamental query operations:
  - Filtering and sorting data
  - Aggregating results with functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`
  - Simple `JOIN` operations across related tables

---

## Technologies Used

- SQL (Structured Query Language)
- MySQL- SQL compatible database

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/thompsonmikej/SQL-practice.git
    cd SQL-practice
    ```
2. **Set up a local database:**  
   You may use MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or an online SQL editor.

3. **Import or create the database schema:**  
   - Use included `.sql` files or follow prompts to create tables as shown in the sample code below:
CREATE TABLE employees (
id INTEGER,
name TEXT,
age INTEGER,
department TEXT
);

text
4. **Run SQL scripts:**  
- Execute SQL queries from the provided scripts or write your own to practice extracting meaningful insights from sample data.

---

## Usage

- Connect to your database using your preferred client or command-line tool.
- Load the sample schema and data.
- Practice writing queries to extract, filter, aggregate, and join information between tables.

---

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

- Built foundational SQL skills through hands-on query writing and data manipulation.
- Learned to use ERDs to understand and visualize data relationships for more effective querying.
- Practiced transforming real-world questions into practical SQL statements for reporting and analysis.

---

## Future Improvements

- Expand the dataset to include more complex relationships and real-world business scenarios.
- Add more advanced queries, including subqueries, advanced joins, and window functions.
- Integrate simple reporting or visualization tools for results analysis.
